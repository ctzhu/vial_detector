What is it?
-----------

**vial_detector** is a Python package for particle tracking in 2D image stack and videos, over noisy background. It is initially designed to detect and track *Drosophila* (fruit fly) motion in glass/clear plastic vials, from video taken with raspberry pi, DSLR, EVF cameras as well as machine vision cameras.
